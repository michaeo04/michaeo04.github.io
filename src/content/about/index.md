Hi, I’m a tech-driven builder with a background in **Management Information Systems** at **National Economics of University** and a strong passion for **product development, business analysis, data, and AI (newbie, i have just a vibecoder lmao)**.  
I enjoy transforming ideas into real, working systems — whether it’s a **mobile app**, a **machine learning model**, or a **clean analytic dashboard**.

Over the past years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects:
- 🧠 **AI & ML**: Car price prediction with Streamlit + LLM recommendations, housing bubble prediction (GSADF + ML), data labeling for transportation AI.
- 📱 **Apps**: Expense management app with receipt-OCR + chatbot input, GMAT e-learning mobile app (Syllabus, lessons, mini-exercises).
- 🛠️ **Systems & Software**: Multiple-choice exam system (.NET + SSMS), university parking system upgrade, internal tools.
- 🍔 **Life experience**: Running Grab to stay active 😭😭, understand user pain points, and strengthen real-world problem-solving.

I love learning new technologies, designing intuitive experiences, and building solutions that are **practical**, **smart** and **delightful to use**.  

My mindset is simple: keep improving, build consistently, and have fun doing it. 
*If this door closes, before you wait for someone else to open another door, try opening the old one first or just go outside and touch the grass.*

## 🌱 My Approach

I approach building with a simple philosophy: **create solutions that genuinely solve real problems**.  
I love identifying a need, designing a clean and practical tech solution, and shaping it into something people actually want to use — something that could even be pitched, invested in, and turned into a sustainable product.

I’m not just chasing features; I’m chasing **impact**, **usability**, and **the possibility of turning ideas into a living, breathing business**.

But life isn’t just one straight path. If this product-building journey doesn’t work out, I’m ready for **Plan B** — becoming a screenwriter or working in film & media, where creativity meets storytelling.  
And if things get extra spicy, there’s always **Plan C**: becoming a full-time trader (high risk, high chaos, high caffeine 😭😭).

No matter the path, my approach stays the same:  
**Build boldly. Learn fast. Stay adaptable.**
