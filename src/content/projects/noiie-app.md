## 💭 Reflection

Building Noiie taught me that **great products aren't just about features** — they're about creating experiences that resonate emotionally with users. The mascot system became the heart of the app, transforming a simple learning tool into a **companion that users care about**.

The biggest challenge was balancing ambitious feature ideas with technical reality. I learned to **ruthlessly prioritize** based on user impact and development feasibility, which resulted in a stronger, more focused MVP.
