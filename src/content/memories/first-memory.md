## The Beginning

Today marks the beginning of my personal portfolio journey. Starting with an empty repository and a clear vision, I'm building something that truly represents me and my work.

## The Process

The development process has been both challenging and rewarding. Learning Astro's content collections system opened my eyes to the power of type-safe content management.

### Key Moments

- **Initial Setup**: Configuring the project structure and understanding Astro's conventions
- **Design System**: Creating a cohesive warm, beige aesthetic that feels welcoming
- **Content Strategy**: Planning how to organize projects, memories, movies, and music

## Reflections

This project isn't just about building a website - it's about creating a personal space on the web that grows with me over time. Each category represents a different facet of my interests and experiences.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to continue adding content and eventually implementing the AI chatbot feature in Phase 2. The foundation is solid, and the possibilities are endless.
